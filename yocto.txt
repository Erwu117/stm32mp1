# To start using bitbake you need to source the "oe-init-build-env" script located into poky/ directory. So you should do something like this every time using bitbake:

cd ~/Projects/yocto
source poky/oe-init-build-env build-mp1
cd build-mp1

bitbake-layers show-layers

bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel

bitbake core-image-minimal	# or one of the images here https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/images.html

# You may continue building the image without starting over by executing the following command

bitbake -f core-image-minimal

# If you want to start over 

bitbake -c cleanall core-image-minimal

# To clean out everything

rm -rf tmp



# Create the final image for the SD card

cd ~/Projects/yocto/build-mp1/tmp/deploy/images/stm32mp1/scripts

./create_sdcard_from_flashlayout.sh ../flashlayout_core-image-minimal/extensible/FlashLayout_sdcard_stm32mp157f-dk2-extensible.tsv

# After unmounting the SD card

sudo dd if=../flashlayout_core-image-minimal/extensible/../../FlashLayout_sdcard_stm32mp157f-dk2-extensible.raw of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=8M conv=fdatasync status=progress oflag=direct

## Voila!


# Adding build tools (including GCC and Nano) to the Linux system

Find the local.conf file (in .../yocto-labs/build/conf) and add these lines (doesnâ€™t seem to matter where but the space before the package name seems to be important!):

	IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " packagegroup-core-buildessential"
	IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " nano"
	IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " apt"

The first line will append the typical GCC build tools. The second line will add the Nano editor (in case you prefer not to work with the VI editor that is part of the minimal Linux system).

# Pay attention to syntax changes in newer versions: https://docs.yoctoproject.org/next/migration-guides/migration-3.4.html


# Make Kernel Changes Permanent

bitbake -c savedefconfig virtual/kernel

Now rebuild the Linux system and flash it to an SD Card. If all went well, you can now use GCC and the Nano editor natively on the STM32MP157F-DK2 board.

# If apt commands give an error like this	E: flAbsPath on /var/lib/dpkg/status failed ; run the following
	touch /var/lib/dpkg/status

	
sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM1
# If you wish to exit picocom, press [Ctrl][a] followed by [Ctrl][x]
